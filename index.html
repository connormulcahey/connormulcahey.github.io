	<blockquote>
		People sometimes think technology just automatically gets better every year but actually it doesn't. It only gets better if smart people work like crazy to make it better. That's how any technology actually gets better. By itself, technology, if people don't work at it, actually will decline. Look at the history of civilizations, many civilizations. Look at, say, ancient Egypt, where they were able to build these incredible pyramids and then they basically forgot how to build pyramids.  And even hieroglyphics. They forgot how to read hieroglyphics. Or if you look at Rome and how they were able to build these incredible roadways and aqueducts and indoor plumbing, they forgot how to do all of those things. There are many such examples in history. So I think we should always bear in mind that entropy is not on your side.

		I hate almost all software.

	<blockquote>
		Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.

	<blockquote>
		We set ourselves goals we know we can’t reach yet, because we know that by stretching to meet them we can get further than we expected.

	<blockquote>
		Most of us lose this confidence as we grow up. Ask a class of first graders which of them thinks they're creative and they'll all put their hands up. Ask a group of college seniors and most of them won't. I believe passionately that that we are all born with tremendous natural capacities, and that we lose touch with many of them as we spend more time in the world. Ironically, one of the many reasons this happens is education. The result is that too many people never connect with their true talents and therefore don't know what they're really capable of achieving.

	<blockquote>
		Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.

	<blockquote>

		Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity and calling it “well-roundedness,” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it. Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substantive—to be a monopoly of one. This is not what young people do today, because everyone around them has long since lost faith in a definite world. No one gets into Stanford by excelling at just one thing, unless that thing happens to involve throwing or catching a leather ball.

		&mdash; a sampling of the contrarian rhetoric of <strong>Peter Thiel's</strong> <a href="http://zerotoonebook.com/">Zero to One</a>
