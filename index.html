		<li><strong>Coding</strong> - mostly web dev, though the web is merely a means to the end of satisfying a creative itch to automate at the seam of minds and machines - <a href=""></a>the protocols, interfaces and abstractions through which we do this in the future are of course <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">subject to change</a></li>
		<li><strong>Reading</strong> - mostly non-fiction - biographies, business, technology, textbooks, and a little too much of <em>Hacker News</em></li>

	<p>I guess this is in lieu of a blog for now. Someday maybe I'll be smart enough to come up with my own.</p>

	<blockquote>
		People sometimes think technology just automatically gets better every year but actually it doesn't. It only gets better if smart people work like crazy to make it better. That's how any technology actually gets better. By itself, technology, if people don't work at it, actually will decline. Look at the history of civilizations, many civilizations. Look at, say, ancient Egypt, where they were able to build these incredible pyramids and then they basically forgot how to build pyramids.  And even hieroglyphics. They forgot how to read hieroglyphics. Or if you look at Rome and how they were able to build these incredible roadways and aqueducts and indoor plumbing, they forgot how to do all of those things. There are many such examples in history. So I think we should always bear in mind that entropy is not on your side.

		Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.

		We set ourselves goals we know we can’t reach yet, because we know that by stretching to meet them we can get further than we expected.

	<blockquote>
		Most of us lose this confidence as we grow up. Ask a class of first graders which of them thinks they're creative and they'll all put their hands up. Ask a group of college seniors and most of them won't. I believe passionately that that we are all born with tremendous natural capacities, and that we lose touch with many of them as we spend more time in the world. Ironically, one of the many reasons this happens is education. The result is that too many people never connect with their true talents and therefore don't know what they're really capable of achieving.

		Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.

	<blockquote>

		Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity and calling it “well-roundedness,” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it. Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substantive—to be a monopoly of one. This is not what young people do today, because everyone around them has long since lost faith in a definite world. No one gets into Stanford by excelling at just one thing, unless that thing happens to involve throwing or catching a leather ball.

		&mdash; a sampling of the contrarian rhetoric of <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>'s <a href="http://zerotoonebook.com/">Zero to One</a>

	<blockquote>
		All greatness of character is dependent on individuality. The man who has no other existence than that which he partakes in common with all around him, will never have any other than an existence of mediocrity.

	<blockquote>
		...teach to the problem, not to the tools. Let’s say you are teaching about how engines work. A more traditional approach would be to have a course on screwdrivers, and one on wrenches, and all these things. This is a very difficult way to do it. A much better way would be like ‘Here’s the engine. Now let’s take it apart. Oh, well you need a screwdriver! That’s what it’s for! And oh, oh you need a wrench, that’s what a wrench is for!’ Then a very important thing happens. The relevance of the tools becomes apparent.

		In formal models, the value of information is quantified as the difference between the expected value realized by optimal decisions made with that information and the expected value realized by optimal decisions made without it.

		My firt year of university was actually quite productive. I managed to earn the number of creadits which are called "study weeks" in the Finnish system&mdash;that one is supposed to earn. It was the only year that happened. Maybe it was the excitement of the new environment, or the opportunity to delve deeply into the topics, or because it was more comfortable for me to study than to become a social animal and puke on my friends with ritualistic regularity. I don't know what to blame for my acceptable performance in that first year. But rest assured, it didn't happen again. My academic career took a sharp nosedive.
