	<h3>My Interests</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Helping</strong> Mr. Musk and the rest of the team to <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html/">conqure</a> <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html">our</a> <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html">future</a></li>
		<li><strong>Coding</strong> mostly web stuff &mdash; though the web is merely a medium to the end of satisfying a creative itch to automate at the seam of minds and machines &mdash; the protocols, interfaces and abstractions through which we do this are of course <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">subject to change</a></li>
		<li><strong>Reading</strong> mostly non-fiction &mdash; biographies, business, technology, textbooks, and a little too much of <em>Hacker News</em></li>
		<li><strong>Pole Vaulting</strong> when I can to give me a fun reason to stay healthy</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>And a Thought</h3>

	<blockquote>
		People sometimes think technology just automatically gets better every year but actually it doesn't. It only gets better if smart people work like crazy to make it better. That's how any technology actually gets better. By itself, technology, if people don't work at it, actually will decline. Look at the history of civilizations, many civilizations. Look at, say, ancient Egypt, where they were able to build these incredible pyramids and then they basically forgot how to build pyramids.  And even hieroglyphics. They forgot how to read hieroglyphics. Or if you look at Rome and how they were able to build these incredible roadways and aqueducts and indoor plumbing, they forgot how to do all of those things. There are many such examples in history. So I think we should always bear in mind that entropy is not on your side.

		</blockquote>

		<p>Thus in this reality we must avoid:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Increasing entropy in our many efforts to reduce it</li>
			<li>Complacency - there is simply too much work to be done</li>
			<li>The negligence that emerges from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html">aiming to win for the sake of winning</a></li>
			<li>Mistaking cynicism for <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/yp/pretending_to_be_wise/">wisdom</a>, or intelligence for conformity</li>
		</ul>
