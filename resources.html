<h1>Resources</h1>
<h2>Things I like in my brief time as a software engineer.</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">Teach Yourself CS</a> All the stuff that’s covered in a CS undergrad, mostly for free. I particularly recommend Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces book</li>
	<ul>
		<li><em>“There are plenty of resources out there, but some are better than others. You don’t need yet another “200+ Free Online Courses” listicle. You need answers to these questions: Which subjects should you learn, and why? What is the best book or video lecture series for each subject?”</em></li>
	</ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks">Destroy All Software talks</a> Some funny talks and some good paid content</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/germanoa/compiladores/blob/master/doc/ebook/The%20C%20Programming%20Language%20-%202nd%20Edition%20-%20Ritchie%20Kernighan.pdf">The C Programming Language</a> – the OG high level programming language. Most languages are written in C first before they get to the point where they can compile themselves. Most modern languages have syntax inspired by C.</li>
	<li><a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/">Learn X in Y Minutes</a> -- pick up languages & technologies quickly. Once you’re proficient in a couple languages (1 with automatic memory management, 1 not) then you can pick up new ones easily and don’t need to re learn for loops and such. For such cases you just need the syntax, features, and unique concepts. For that, this website is perfect. I picked up C# in a day with this for my SpaceX interview</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a> - straight forward web tutorials (not associated with the actual W3)</li>
	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> – super extensive web documentation. More detailed than W3 but has a lot of the same begineer tutorials and extensive docs</li>
	<li><a href="https://codepen.io">HTML/CSS/JS prototyping tool</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com">CSS Tricks</a>front end tips and resources, particularly the almanac and snippets</li>
	<ul>
		<li>e.g. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flex box guide</a></li>
	</ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial">Learn enough command line to be dangerous</a> - Learn the UNIX/Linux/MacOS terminal (much friendlier than Windows PowerShell / DOS)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial">Learn Enough Git To Be Dangerous</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 ">Pro Git</a> - THE git book</li>
	<li><a href="http://railscasts.com/">Rails Casts</a> - Somewhat out of data but well paced tutorials on Rails web framework. Rails IMO is probably a better place to start to learn web dev (i.e. building apps with back ends and databases) than .NET. Last time I did NodeJS stuff it didn't feel too mature but i'm sure that's changed now.</li>
	<li><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails official docs</a>. Also <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book">rails tutorial</a> from the same era (bit dated now)</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston">The New Boston</a> Dude on youtube with video series for basically everything. This is where I learned to program ~9 years ago (Objective C)</li>
	<li>Good practice thing to try: make yourself a personal website from scratch. </li>
</ul>
